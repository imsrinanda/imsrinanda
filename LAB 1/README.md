Lab 1
Objective:
The objective of the lab assignment to create a menu function in python for handling csv files without the help of any libraries. We will also see how to open, read and use indexing function in a csv file without the use of any packages and make a histogram file.

Procedure:
Q1: We have to open a csv file and read it. This can be done using open() funcition. Then we read the csv file using, readlines().
Q2: In this question, we used indexing to seperate headers from the csv file.
Q3: In the 3rd question, we used nested for loop to iterate through each element of the csv file and conditional statement to filter out the marital status present in the csv file. Then we added 1 to the variable a to calculate the total value of a.
Q4: In the 4th question we used for loop to iterate through each element of the csv file. And we used another for loop to convert the string function to integer type.
Then, we made user defined funciton for every code.
Lastly, we used input function and conditional statements to create a menu option for the user to choose what option they want to view.

Result:
The result will show the menu option for the users. The users can choose the option according to their needs.
